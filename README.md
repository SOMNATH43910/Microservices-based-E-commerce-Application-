# 🐳 Dockerized Deployment

Run entire system using:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

All services run independently and communicate via internal network.

---

# 📈 Scalability & Production Readiness

- Stateless services
- Independent service deployment
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Easily extendable architecture
- Cloud-ready structure

---

# ⭐ Why This Project Stands Out

- Real Microservices Implementation
- Secure Authentication with JWT
- API Gateway Integration
- Production-Oriented Structure
- Clean Code & Modular Design
- Expandable Architecture

---

# 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Service Discovery (Eureka)
- Kafka Event-Driven Architecture
- Redis Caching
- CI/CD Integration
- Kubernetes Deployment
- Distributed Tracing (Zipkin)
